# Traffic Density Analysis Project

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook presents a traffic density analysis using machine learning techniques. The aim is to quantify traffic by counting vehicles in specified areas from video footage and categorizing traffic flow as 'Heavy' or 'Smooth'. This analysis is vital for urban planning and traffic management applications.
